Due: Feb. 20, 2020

This archive has three files in it:
	1. readme.txt: the file that contains information about the 
	   other files used in this project
	2. sde1_sp2020.caml: The functions that were designed for 
	   sde1. Contains the functions and helper functions: nextState;
	   updateN; findsEqulibrium; energy; HopTrainAState; and hopTrain
	3. sde1.log: log file that contains the outputs of the functions
	   to test to make sure that they are working properly. 

On my honor I have neither given nor received aid on this exam.
